# Video of large GMO simulation

https://youtu.be/AJgjb1KXwCo

## Description

2 million atom simulation of a 5:1 water:GMO system in n-dodecane (not shown), 51ns total runtime.
1010 molecules of GMO, 5050 molecules of water, and 50500 molecules of n-dodecane.
Carbons are shown in grey, water oxygens are shown in blue, GMO oxygens in red, and hydrogens are shown in white.

# Snapshots

All snapshots share the same atom representation:
GMO and iron oxide atoms are shown in space-filling representation, while _n_-dodecane are shown in stick representation.
GMO Carbon atoms are shown in black, GMO and surface oxygens are shown in red, water oxygens are shown in blue, hydrogens are shown in white, iron atoms are shown in pink, and _n_-dodecane is shown in gray.

Molecular configurations at the end of 20 runs: (a) a reverse micelle of 18 GMO molecules in pure _n_-dodecane. (b) a reverse micelle of 28 GMO molecules and 150 water molecules, in _n_-dodecane. 

## gmo\_large.png

Molecular configurations of a large amount of GMO micelles with water at a 5:1 water:gmo ratio, at the end of a 51ns simulation run.


## gmo\_surfaces.png

Molecular configurations at the end of 10ns runs. (a)--(c) show surfaces in dry simulations, and (d)--(f) show surfaces in wet simulations. (a) and (d) represent full GMO coverage, (b) and (e) half coverage, and (c) and (f) quarter coverage.
