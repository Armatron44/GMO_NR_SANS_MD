## Experimental and Simulation Study of Self-Assembly and Surface Adsorption of Glycerol Monooleate in *n*-Dodecane onto Iron Oxide

The scripts used to initialise the MD simulations & those for the subsequent analysis are shared in the MD directory. <br>
The depletion isotherm data and analysis is available in the Depletion_Isotherm directory. <br>
The scripts used to analyse the reduced data from the SANS and NR experiments are found in their respective folders. <br>
The comparison of the SLD profiles generated from the MD simulations to the measured reflectivity is found in the NR_MD_compare directory.
