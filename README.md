## Experimental and Simulation Study of Self-Assembly and Surface Adsorption of Glycerol Monooleate in *n*-Dodecane onto Iron Oxide

The scripts used to analyse the reduced data from the SANS and NR experiments are found in their respective folders. <br>
The comparison of the SLD profiles generated from the MD simulations to the measured reflectivity is found in the NR_MD_compare.
