## Scripts to analyse the NR data collected with dodecane solutions containing GMO.

python modules requirements to completely recreate:<br>
refl1d, bumps, refnx, dynesty, jupyter, uravu

The three nested sampling scripts (for models 1, 2 & 3) are within the M1_NS, M2_NS and M3_NS directories.
These three scripts use MixedMagSlabs2.py<br>

The (refl1d-DREAM) fit of model 1 was conducted with M2_PTMCMC.py<br>

The NR_data_present_M2 notebook can be used to recreate Fig 10.<br>
The Calculate_Areas_of_overlap notebook was used to calculate the fraction of area of Si contacting Fe.
